# Peach Blossom E-Store

Peach Blossom is a full-stack web app and mock e-commerce site I created in order to teach myself typescript, redux, and mysql. It comprises a node/express back-end supported by lambda functions and a bifurcated front-end website consisting of a customer-facing e-store and a full-featured admin panel with sales analytics and inventory, product, and order management. The site relies on a combination of mysql and mongodb for data persistence. Most of the images and text are ai-generated. Though the products arenâ€™t real and the site does not accept or process real payments, it is otherwise fully functional.
